{"note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","name":"WillJS","google":"","tagline":"A great way to load assets on-demand and to create components for webpages.","body":"### Demo\r\nConsider the following page:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n<a href=\"javascript:will.call('popMessage')('Hello, this is a message on a dialog!');\">\r\n   click here!</a>\r\n<script src=\"javascripts/will/will.min.js\"></script>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nQuite simple, right? There is nothing more than an external asset in this page (the will.min.js file). Note that the link element of this example has a weird calling, but still is possible to understand that a message will be displayed to the user by somewhere. __Open the debugger of your browser to see what will happen__. (after that, try it: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"will.call('popMessage')('Hello, this is a message on a dialog!'); return false;\">click here</a>)!\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
